      Welcome to Fox Creek Golf course website. This site as of now is mostly for create events,
      adding groups, and setting up golfer's.
      This site was designed to help our Administration have a consistant way of doing what we have
      been doing for years on paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have big plans for this site in the near future. For example letting sponsors and golfer's a
      like be more involed in our site. We would like to
      be able to allow no admins to sign up for event as well as see how they did compared to other's
      in past events.
    </p>
    <p>The possiblites are truely endless.
      Maybe this could one day be the go to software system of all aspects golf for all golf courses.
      Too ambishish maybe, but so was that shoot you took the other day
      thinking you could make it over the water hazard.
